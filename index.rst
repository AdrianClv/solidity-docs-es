Solidity is a contract-oriented, high-level language whose syntax is similar to that of JavaScript
and it is designed to target the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).

Solidity is statically typed, supports inheritance, libraries and complex
user-defined types among other features.

As you will see, it is possible to create contracts for voting,
crowdfunding, blind auctions, multi-signature wallets and more.

.. note::
    The best way to try out Solidity right now is using
    `Remix <https://remix.ethereum.org/>`_
    (it can take a while to load, please be patient).

Language Documentation
----------------------

On the next pages, we will first see a :ref:`simple smart contract <simple-smart-contract>` written
in Solidity followed by the basics about :ref:`blockchains <blockchain-basics>`
and the :ref:`Ethereum Virtual Machine <the-ethereum-virtual-machine>`.

The next section will explain several *features* of Solidity by giving
useful :ref:`example contracts <voting>`
Remember that you can always try out the contracts
`in your browser <https://remix.ethereum.org>`_!

The last and most extensive section will cover all aspects of Solidity in depth.

If you still have questions, you can try searching or asking on the
`Ethereum Stackexchange <https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/>`_
site, or come to our `gitter channel <https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity/>`_.
Ideas for improving Solidity or this documentation are always welcome!
